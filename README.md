# MechaCar Statistical Analysis

## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition
* We are testing the MPG and AWD metrics.
* The null hypothesis is the two groups are not equal.
* Using the two-sample t-test would allow for better visualization when comparing the difference between the distribution means.  
* Data with approximately the same variance would be needed in order to complete this test.
